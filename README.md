Global_active_power: household global mi|nute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global active power is a term used in electrical engineering to
refer to the total active power consumption of a building or an entire electrical
grid. It is a measure of the real power used by electrical devices and is expressed in watts (W).

Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Global reactive power is a term used in electrical engineering to refer to the
total reactive power consumption of a building or an entire electrical grid.
It is a measure of the amount of electrical power that is flowing back and forth between
the source and the load in an alternating current (AC) electrical system, and it doesn't do any
useful work, but it is necessary to maintain the voltage level in the system. It is expressed in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).

Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is a
measure of the electrical potential energy per unit charge in an electrical circuit. It is the force that drives
the flow of electric charge in a circuit, and is expressed in volts (V).

Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Global intensity refers to the overall or average current flow
in an electrical system or network, such as a building or an entire electrical grid. It is a measure of the
amount of electric charge moving through a conductor per unit of time and is expressed in amperes (A).

Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).
It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher,
an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy).
It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine,
a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).
It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
